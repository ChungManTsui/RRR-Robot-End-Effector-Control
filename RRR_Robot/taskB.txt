target_update_rate = 5   
control_loop_rate = 50  


result:
Target Updates: 
* At 5 Hz, the robot receives a new target position every 0.2 seconds.before that at 30 Hz, it received updates every 0.033 seconds.
that mean the robot has to guess the target movement for longer between updates.


Control Loop:
* At 50 Hz, the control system adjusts the robot’s movement every 0.02 seconds. Before, at 1000 Hz, it was adjusting every 0.001 seconds (1 ms).
that mean the robot can’t react as quickly or as smoothly.

More Lag: 
* The robot lags much more behind the moving target

Jump:
* The end-effector(EE) will look less smooth
* may “jump” or appear to move in steps, because it only gets new target data every 0.2 seconds.

Instability:
* The robot may not track the target closely or may exhibit overshoot
* With delayed updates, the robot sometimes may be not correct 
* With delayed updates, the robot sometimes may be going past the target 

Compare Task A to Task B:
Task A: 
end-effector(EE) closely follows the green dashed line (target path) looking smooth , not appear any lag and jump
Task B:
end-effector(EE) lags and not smooth, sometime may fail to track all
